            <p class="gold"> I am a lover of video games and sports, specifically, athletics and 
                football. I attended Amerol Nursery School for my pre-school education, after which 
                I attended Falsssyyyd Foundation School for my basic education.</p>

                <p class="green">I went on to further my education in Presbyterian Boys' Senior High School
                    where I studied General Arts with Economics, Geography, Elective Mathematics and 
                    Government as elective subjects. After spending three years in the second cycle education system, I was
                enrolled in University of Ghana, Legon for my tertiary education where I studied Geography and Sociology (combined). </p>
